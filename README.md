![.NET](https://github.com/bartvanhoey/DomainDrivenDesignWorkshop/workflows/.NET/badge.svg?branch=main)

## Introduction

This is a **free hands-on Domain Driven Design workshop** wherein the **DDD main concepts** will be explained.

The **main goal** of this workshop is to provide students/teachers/developers/architects with **a free practical guide to study/teach DDD concepts**. It is based on the [Implementing Domain Driven Design Guide](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Domain-Driven-Design-Implementation-Guide) you can find in the **ABP Framework Documents**.

In this **step-by-step workshop** you will create an **IssueTracking application** following Domain Driven Design techniques.

The **sample application** that comes with this workshop is developed with the **ABP Framework**, as this framework already has been written with Domain Driven Design principles in mind. It uses **Blazor** as UI framework and **SQL Server** as database provider.

While the workshop makes use of the ABP Framework infrastructure, **all the DDD core concepts, principles and patterns are applicable in any kind of solution**, even if it is not a .NET solution.

You will have **a good understanding of Domain Driven Design** when you finish this workshop.
