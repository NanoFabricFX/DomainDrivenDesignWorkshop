# Domain Driven Design Workshop

![.NET](https://github.com/bartvanhoey/DomainDrivenDesignWorkshop/workflows/.NET/badge.svg?branch=main)

## Introduction

This is a **free hands-on DDD workshop** wherein the **main concepts of Domain Driven Design** will be explained.

The **main goal** of this workshop is to provide students/teachers/developers/architects with **a free practical guide to study/teach DDD concepts**. It is based on the [Implementing Domain Driven Design](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Domain-Driven-Design-Implementation-Guide) guide you can find in the **ABP Framework Documents**.

In this **step-by-step workshop** you will create an **IssueTracking application** following Domain Driven Design techniques.

The **sample application** that comes with this workshop is developed with the **ABP Framework**, as this framework already has been written with Domain Driven Design principles in mind. It uses **Blazor** as UI framework and **SQL Server** as database provider, but you could also choose **Angular** in combination with **MongoDb**, if that suits your needs better.

While the workshop makes use of the ABP Framework infrastructure, all the DDD core concepts, principles and patterns are applicable in any kind of solution, even if it is not a .NET solution.

When you have finished this workshop you will have **a good understanding of Domain Driven Design** together with a **solid knowledge of the ABP Framework**.

### Target audience

**Developers, software architects, teachers, professors and students** who want to learn more about DDD concepts.

* **Introduce and explain** the DDD architecture, concepts, principles, patterns and building blocks.
