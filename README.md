![.NET](https://github.com/bartvanhoey/DomainDrivenDesignWorkshop/workflows/.NET/badge.svg?branch=main)

## Introduction

This is a **free Domain Driven Design workshop** wherein the **main concepts of DDD** will be explained.

The **main goal** of this workshop is to provide software architects/developers/trainers/students/teachers with **a free practical guide to study/teach DDD concepts**. It is based on the [Implementing Domain Driven Design Guide](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Domain-Driven-Design-Implementation-Guide) you can find in the **ABP Framework Documents**.

In this **hands-on workshop** you will create an **IssueTracking application** following Domain Driven Design techniques.

The **sample application** that comes with this workshop is developed with the [ABP Framework](https://abp.io/), as this framework already has been written with Domain Driven Design principles in mind. It uses **Blazor** as UI framework and **SQL Server** as database provider.

While the workshop makes use of the ABP Framework infrastructure, **all the DDD core concepts, principles and patterns are applicable in any kind of solution**, even if it is not a .NET solution.

You will have **a good understanding of Domain Driven Design** when you finish this workshop.
