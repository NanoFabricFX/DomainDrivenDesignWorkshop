## Introduction

This is a **practical guide** for implementing the Domain Driven Design (DDD). While the implementation details rely on the ABP Framework infrastructure, core concepts, principles and patterns are applicable in any kind of solution, even if it is not a .NET solution.

### Goals

The goals of this document are to

* **Introduce and explain** the DDD architecture, concepts, principles, patterns and building blocks.
* Explain the **layered architecture** & solution structure offered by the ABP Framework.
* Introduce **explicit rules** to implement DDD patterns and best practices by giving **concrete examples**.
* Show what **ABP Framework provides** you as the infrastructure for implementing DDD in a proper way.
* And finally, provide **suggestions** based on software development **best practices** and our experiences to create a **maintainable codebase**.

### Simple Code!

> **Playing football** is very **simple**, but **playing simple football** is the **hardest thing** there is.

If we take this famous quote for programming, we can say;

> **Writing code** is very **simple**, but **writing simple code** is the **hardest thing** there is.
> &mdash; <cite>???</cite>

In this document, we will introduce **simple rules**, those are **easy to implement**.

Once your **application grows**, it will be **hard to follow** these rules. Sometimes you find **breaking rules** will save you time in a short term. However, the saved time in the short term will bring much **more time loss** in the middle and long term. Your code base becomes **complicated** and hard to maintain. Most of the business applications are **re-written** just because you **can't maintain** it anymore.

If you **follow the rules and best practices**, your code base will be simpler and easier to maintain. Your application **reacts to changes** faster.
